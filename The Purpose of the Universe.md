The Purpose of the Universe

The idea that an entity possesses a purpose may be formally captured using the mathematics of optimization 20. In particular, the entity may be conceived as a maximizing agent, and its objective—and the means it has to pursue this objective—may be defined by an optimization program 21:

$$ s \max_{s\in S} f(s) $$

(3)
The key elements of the optimization program are: $S$, the set of all strategies that may be used; and $f$, the real-valued objective function, which describes how well the objective is realized upon adoption of each strategy (larger values are better). The optimization program captures purpose as a maximization problem: find the strategy $s$, belonging to the strategy set $S$, that maximizes the objective function $f$.

The optimization program permits a formal definition of optimality. An optimal strategy $s^*$ is any member of the strategy set that cannot be bettered by any other member of the strategy set, that is, $f(s^*) \geq f(s) \forall s \in S$. Conversely, a suboptimal strategy $(s^\circ)$ is any member of the strategy set that can be bettered by at least one other member of the strategy set, that is, $\exists s \in S$ such that $f(s) > f(s^\circ)$. Importantly, the optimization program allows one to decouple the notion of purpose from the notion of optimality. The program can be constructed, making the design objective concrete, without implying that optimality actually obtains.

We consider the idea that the design objective of the universe is to produce black holes 13. Formally, the universe is considered as a maximizing agent using its character type $t$ as a means to the end of maximizing lifetime manufacture of black holes, $B(t)$. Hence, we write:
$$ t \max_{t\in \mathbb{R}^N} B(t) $$
(4)
This formalizes the notion of the universe having a purpose. It also permits a formal definition for optimality in relation to the design of universes: an optimal character type $(t^*)$ is any member of the set of possible character types that cannot be bettered, that is, $B(t^*) \geq B(t) \forall t \in \mathbb{R}^N$. Conversely, a suboptimal character type $(t^\circ)$ is a member of the set of all possible character types that can be bettered, that is, $\exists t \in \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $B(t) > B(t^\circ)$.
